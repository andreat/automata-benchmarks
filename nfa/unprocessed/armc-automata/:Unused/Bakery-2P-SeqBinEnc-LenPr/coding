2 processes, 2 counters

One process: 
3 control states
i initial
w waiting
c critical
4 transitions

configuration: ii.two counters in binary

two counters in binary: coded in alternation
10101100 means counter1 = 1110 = 14 and counter2 =0010= 2

Process 1:
transitions: 
trans1: i to w with taking counter1 := counter2 + 1
trans2: w to c if counter2 = 0
trans3: w to c if counter1 < counter2
trans4: c to i with counter1 := 0

Process 2:
the same with trans1s, etc.
