# Benchmarks from translation of S1S to B√ºchi automata

These benchmarks were obtained by the tool from [here](https://github.com/barbora4/projektova-praxe) on the formulae from the paper

* Barth S. (2016) Deciding Monadic Second Order Logic over ùúî-Words by Specialized Finite Automata. In: √Åbrah√°m E., Huisman M. (eds) Integrated Formal Methods. IFM 2016. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 9681. Springer, Cham. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-33693-0_16

## Directory structure
 * `direct/`: direct encoding of S1S set variables into atomic propositions
 * `one-hot/`: one-hot encoding (each Boolean combination of S1S variables is given an atomic proposition)
