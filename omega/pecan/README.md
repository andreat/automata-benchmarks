# Benchmarks obtained from Pecan

***Pecan*** is an automated theorem prover for automatic sequences using BÃ¼chi automata.
For more details, see the [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01727)
and the [repository](http://reedoei.com/pecan).

Note that bigger automata were removed and some runs of Pecan did not
terminate.  You can obtain more and/or bigger automata by running Pecan.
