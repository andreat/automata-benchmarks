# Random benchmarks from State of Büchi Complementation

These benchmarks contain state-based acceptance Büchi automata from the paper
below and were downloaded from [GOAL's
webpage](http://goal.im.ntu.edu.tw/wiki/doku.php).

They are randomly generated using the Tabakov-Vardi model (Tabakov, D., Vardi,
M.Y.: [Experimental evaluation of classical automata
constructions](https://doi.org/10.1007/11591191_28). In: Proc. of LPAR’05,
Springer (2005) 396–411) over a two letter alphabet, starting with 15/20
states, with various different parameters.  No post-processing is applied to
those automata, so some pre-filtering/reductions might be necessary (see the
directories with HOA format for some pre-processed inputs).
